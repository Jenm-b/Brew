# Brew ‚òïÔ∏è

The Brew App is written in SwiftUI and follows an MVVM-C architecture (kind-of lol).

### App Aim 

The Brew App helps you keep track of your family's, friends' and work colleagues' hot drink preferences, because let's face it, it can be tough to remember everyone's go-to beverage.

### Key Features
  - Create, edit and delete drinks.
  - Sort drinks by type or username.
  - View list of drinks in list or grid format.
  - Share drinks.
  - 13 hot drink types available - including coffee, tea, herbal teas and more.
  - 10 milk types available - including dairy and plant-based varieties.
  - Choose custom app icon.
  - Choose light or dark theme.
